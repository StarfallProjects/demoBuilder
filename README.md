# Interactive Demo Template

An 11ty template, designed for creating demo sites.

This project was inspired by some product management work I did for a client. I needed to present the initial research and workflows for a new product. Not being a designer, or at all familiar with design tools, it seemed quicker to create a simple website. This turned out to have several benefits:

* An interactive, shareable demo site, useful for presenting to management.
* A way to thoroughly think through the workflow and functionality of the app.
* A clear demonstration of ideas and requirements, which can then be picked up by design and development.

> The demo site is intended to be an intermediate step between initial notes and ideas, and wireframing. You could create a detailed wireframe on top of this skeleton, but it would take some effort.
