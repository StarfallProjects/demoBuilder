This is an [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) project, designed for creating interactive software demos. It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Background

This project was inspired by some product management work I did for a client. I needed to present the initial research and workflows for a new product. Not being a designer, or at all familiar with design tools, it seemed quicker to create a simple website. This turned out to have several benefits:

* An interactive, shareable demo site, useful for presenting to management.
* A way to thoroughly think through the workflow and functionality of the app.
* A clear demonstration of ideas and requirements, which can then be picked up by design and development.
